Demo program about snowball algorithm
Each node init a local list of integer (each item has value between 0 and 9)
Our demo will sync all data to get the final result. 
After running the result, we can check in log folder, each node has a log file. We can check the log files to verify our program


1. Tools:
- Go 1.18
- GNU Make 4.2.1

2. Run:
- Step 1: Kill previous processes: make kill
- Step 2: Run demo: make demo

3. Check result: open the log file. 
- The log files contain data that format like:

Init data: [1 4 0 8 4 0 6 6]
Start syncing ... 4
End syncing ... 4
Final result [6 1 6 6 0 3 4 1]

- The first line of each file contain the initial data of the node. For data above: "Init data: [1 4 0 8 4 0 6 6]"
- The lat line of each file contain the final result after syncing. For data above: "Final result [6 1 6 6 0 3 4 1]"
